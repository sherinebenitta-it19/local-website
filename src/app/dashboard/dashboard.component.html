<p style="color:black;font-size:30px;">Our sweet home is really charming. It is situated at our village Tilakpur in Pabna. It faces the south. A small river flows by our village. There are three houses in our home. All the houses are tin-shed houses. Sheets of corrugated iron, wood, bamboo and nails and screws have been used to build the houses. There is a courtyard in front of my home. Our family consists of five members. They are my parents, my elder brother and only sister. My father is the earning member of the family. My parents love us very much. We live in our home happily. We always get fresh air. There are fruit trees in our home. In front of our home there is a flower garden. I have a separate reading room in my home. All the members of my family are loving and like friends. My mother prepares cake and delicious food now and then. I like my home very much. It is an ideal abode of peace and happiness. We are lucky to have a home like this. I feel that there is no place like my home.</p>
